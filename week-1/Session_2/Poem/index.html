    <p>
      I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br />
      Are you - Nobody - Too?<br />
      Then there's a pair of us!<br />
      Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      How dreary - to be - Somebody! <br />
      public - like a Frog - <br />To tell one's name - the livelong June -
      <br />To an admiring Bog!
    </p>
